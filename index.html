            <div class="productCol">
                <h1>MeshCare</h1>
                <h2>One of the main goals of MeshCare is to try to make meshes that prevent adhesions on the wrong side of the body. The mesh could only go on one side because if it goes onto the side with intestines, the patient is in extreme danger risk. Additionally, the team is working to make a membrane mesh hybrid and biodegradable because that will lower the chances of complications during MeshCare's usage.</h2>

                <h1>RepliVax</h1>
                <h2>RepliVax is a vaccine intended to treat the West Nile virus, specifically in third world countries in Africa. It will be consumed orally and will use electroporation which makes holes in the cell membranes to get the drug into cells. The bigger picture issue at hand is that there are significant challenges in getting potent drugs to the sub-Saharan region of Africa. The key weakness of the current cold chain transportation method is that during certain parts of the process, the cold temperature cannot be maintained, therefore degrading the drug. Currently, the team is working on improving the cold chain method and deliver potent drugs to Africa without losing the drugs' efficiency.</h2>

                <h1>VitaClick</h1>
                <h2>VitaClick is a triple-click injector system for myocardial infarctions. It has two chamber systems, which is a solid and liquid component, that are broken together to make the drug. This system extends the shelf life of the product. The group is currently working on the Auto CAD, which is known as computer aid design. Theyâ€™re creating the triple-click injector system parts. In order to 3D print it, they need to scale it to an accurate measurement and make new designs and parts. The legal sector has found the competitors of VitaClick and is waiting for the research sector to have the design so they can make the design patent.</h2>

                <h1>PatchAid</h1>
                <h2>PatchAid is a transdermal patch used to aid hypertrophic scarring management. It prevents HTS from occurring after burns. Myofibroblasts are the cells that produce excess collagen when they receive Substance P and resultantly cause hypertrophic scarring, so the patch inhibits the receptors of Substance P to prevent hypertrophic scarring from occurring.</h2>
